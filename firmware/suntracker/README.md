# How to build

## Arduino IDE

Use the 1.6.5 Arduino IDE (ignore 1.6.6 because it's buggy with esp8266 by now):
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino

## Platformio

If you prefer command line tools, you have an excellent option with platformio

Get started with: http://platformio.org/#!/get-started

And then, from this directory:

* platformio run
* platformio run -t upload [--upload-port IP]
